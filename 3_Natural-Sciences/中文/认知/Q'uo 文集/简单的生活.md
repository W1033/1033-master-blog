周日冥想 1993年9月5日




**团体问题**：今天的问题是我们要如何开放自己朝向那种不执着于结果的觉知。当我们在一天中做任何事时——不论是将一项灵性法则运用于一个情境中，还是赚钱，又或是自我反思——我们都倾向于用一种标准来衡量事情的结果，因此我们为自己设定了期待，期待事情最终将怎样被完成，以及最终制造出的结果要如何。因此，我们觉察到，若我们能不执着于结果——即无论经历什么，我们都将敞开自己——那件事情的结果会比我们从来能想象的要好得多。当我们对结果有所期待时，我们的体验就不是那么和谐，然后我们便会评判自己。所以，我们要去了解关于如何打开自己、迎向接纳我们任何处境的觉知。

*（Carla**传讯）*



我们是Q’uo。在太一无限造物者的爱与光中致意。被呼唤至这次工作集会来与你们分享我们的服务，这真是一种荣幸与祝福。确实，我们由衷感谢且乐于来分享一些意见和经历。由于我们并非完美的权威，而是与你们一样的真理寻求者，我们恳请在座的每一位都能以自己的分辨力去聆听并留心你们所听见的东西。我们不愿成为任何人的绊脚石。理解了这点，我们便可以说，这次特定的工作集会对于我们是一次真正的乐事，因为每一位在场者都将某些新事物带至这份振动样式——即我们通过你们所说的时间通道而已经越来越熟悉的振动样式。现在，进入我们的主题。

 

如果你们愿意，想象一棵早春的树。在漫长的冬眠中，一直是光秃秃的，除了几片枯叶。当空气和大地逐渐解冻，维持生命的养分在树的体内被创造出来，由根部上涌和下流，有条不紊地滋养和鼓舞着这棵树及其所有成员的生长。当每个幼芽逐渐显现，从巨大树干的每个部分微微露头时，叶子想过它该做什么吗？每一个微小的造物，每一片枝芽，每一种第二密度的存有，对于嫩叶到叶片这个极其复杂的发育过程之完美，都有充分的无意识觉知；而且，该过程完美地发生着。

 

当第三密度开始之际，那些已经在第二密度被个体化、接着被收割到第三密度的实体接收到伟大的礼物，而在之前，所有的觉察和知识都是无意识的、却是饱满的。所以，现在第三密度提供了自我意识、自我觉察的礼物，但是，同样有个平衡式的礼物，那即是在显意识与无意识的心智或心智层次之间有个面纱掉落下来，于是，不再有对正在发生的过程的完美无意识觉察。那么，第三密度就开始于无意识的心智(变得)完全不透明。

 

在你们人群当中，那些已经借由选择或地理设计而被遗留下来、形成了简单社会的实体们，他们已经更成功地达成了一种与[我们称为的]命运的再托付关系，因此，他们对待好事和表面上的坏事的态度依然是合作与接纳的。然而，在你们的文化中，有相当多的一部分人没有显而易见的机会去过简单的生活——这种生活足够小，以至于在一处做着一些与赚钱无关的小工作就可以生活了。这些工作变得奢侈，而且实体们在巨大压力下选择去怀有抱负并追求这些抱负，无论是在物质供给的世界中，还是在智力提升世界中，抑或在灵性寻求的世界中。

 

这种基本的态度经常在贯穿整个学校岁月、教育自我的过程中看起来是在明显起作用的——去阅读、做事、学习、搜集、积累、变得更觉察。这些抱负创造出极大的复杂性。去重新安排(relocate)，以便在保持简单生活者的态度的同时有可能过着这种复杂的生活方式——这是一种寻求，这种寻求在下述这些实体当中[我们会说]几乎是很普遍的：他们已经有意识地选择去追求活出一次依据信心而非依据言语的人生。

 

那个被知晓为耶稣的实体是一位老师，他的话语经常讲述有关「在一次忙碌的投生中选择成为一名真理的朝圣者、寻求者或信徒」的过程。这个实体经常提议非常困难的可能性：去注视，去选择成为一个完全又彻底的朝圣者，除了一套衣服外，放弃一切世俗之物，不去担心钱的问题，踏上那条路……这对于开始简化一个人的世俗关切也是一种好办法。然而，一种社会精神气质(ethos)或「文化类型」的影响是微妙的，且会涉入任何所选的生活方式中，无论其看似多简单。以特定模式去思考的文化性压力，几乎无可避免地在这个实体所称的「劈柴挑水」周围创造出某种程度的复杂性——其程度与这些压力会给一个带有延伸责任的专业人士创造出的复杂性的程度一样高。换句话说，虽然选择一种更简化的生活方式可能看似有助于发展一种更和谐的态度，但任何外在的物质环境仅仅为这样的结果提供了潜能。在每个例子中，正是寻求者的心智借由渴望而创造了自己所渴望的东西。

 

渴望的过程是什么呢？一个人也许可以将渴望描绘为「一种坠入爱河」。肯定地，心之渴望是被深深感受到的，并且是以爱之笔所刻画的。每个寻求者在特定时期都曾体验过的那种对于「平衡好的(centered)、流动的、不费劲的生活」的渴望是恒常的，有时几乎是无法抗拒的。寻求者多么渴慕去感受那份与生命、光、爱、真理的源泉全然连接在一起的感觉呀！每位寻求者都有能力去如此锻炼其想法和态度，于是越来越多地拥有一种增强的潜能来返回心与意的一个平衡好的位置——在其中，对于「改善这种平衡好的姿态」这件事，一种真正的简化被达成了。

 

让我们提出另一个问题，即每个寻求者的感知过程是怎样的，因为这个问题是趋近下述目标的一条更有趣的道路之起始：成为那种每一位都希望去成为的平衡好的实体。感知过程是极其众多的。当一个实体醒着的时候，为了感知任何事，肉体的五官全时间地向你们称为大脑的生物电脑发送数百万条、确实是千万条的资讯。你的大脑使用着自你出生之前就开始用以接受(讯息)的程式。为了优先处理(庞大)输入资料中的重要部分，在所有综合的感官资讯中，真正随时能被选中使用的大概只有1%或2%，而其余资讯都被存在你们所称为大脑的、非常巨大的储存空间中。因此，如果一个实体想要改变态度，我们觉得在一刻刻飞逝之际处理下述问题是个好主意：何种感官资料获得了被显意识心智优先考虑的地位。

 

**一个寻求者如何才能与那个****[****过滤感官知觉的]****无意识心智部分沟通呢？该实体单纯是在与自我的那部分沟通。这种沟通的开始是静默冥想。对于每个实体来说，这过程是不同的。有些人会以一种静默聆听的方法得到更新，另一些人则采用第二种，如此等等。每种途径对于那个(****与之相应的)****实体来说都是好的；亦是独特的。那么，为了改善那种沟通，开端是你要以你独特的方式去冥想，用你的方式去忠实于你所忆起的每一点。因为你看到，当你坐下冥想片刻，就会忆起你是谁，在那静默之内，不论你觉得自己在保持静默上有多不完美，你都等同于是在敲着潜意识或深层心智的那扇门，说着：「我准备好接收来自你的资料了，我希望，以此种方式，在这组情感和态度中来探索这份静默。」接着，深层心智听见且理解了，你又迈出了一小步，将生活的席位从大脑及其智力环境中转移到心，伴随着毫不评判以及感觉之纯粹，因为真实的智慧存在于情感之内，而这些情感借由聚焦而逐渐被净化**。

 

一旦这些习惯已经形成，并且那种生命自由流动的感觉已被体验过，那么这种感受就能在简单的重复——我们更正这个器皿——重复的练习中，被寻求者越发优雅和轻松地取得，而非创造，因为如你们每个人真实觉察到的，你所寻求的整体已然在那里。它是一种允许，允许那种被需要的感觉在那儿；这种允许述说着下述话语，并将其带入你的感知过程：「此刻我想要关于爱的讯息。它在哪？我想要在那儿与这些能量一同合作。」

 

我们知道每个人将会多次对自己感到失望。我们鼓励每个人把这感觉当作一个过程中的一个可爱部分；内在的改变借由这个过程而被达成，适用于每个细小的蜕变、每份「去选择基于灵性的讯息而非其他优先项」的新能力。有些过去的优先项将会丢失，并且，随着心与意更改其习惯，老旧和陈腐的事物必定会脱落。这被感知为痛苦的。

 

因此，我们要说的是：伴随着与命运协作的生命之流，会有一种持续性的不适感，这种不适来自于(你)比其他实体更为迅速的改变，正如你所愿。然而，对于大多数下述实体而言，这是个简单的选择；这些实体宁愿保持觉醒、对无限临在怀有觉知，也不愿成为投生之梦中的沉睡者——他们除了随着社会路线流动以外不要求自己做其他事。

 

我们的确鼓励每个人不止加入这个加速有意识生活的过程，并且还鼓励并劝告每个人，在态度中去找寻一种逐渐增强的觉察——觉察到内在所感受到的爱如何是一个通道，造物者的无限之爱经由它而流向他人。让那内在之光出现。敞开你的自我，有意识地流动，于是你得以成为善的一部分、进入你所接触的那些人的生活中。有时候，对于一个陌生人来说，没有什么比一个支持的微笑更能在那个特定时刻缔造不同了。当你获赐恩典，脱离了忧伤与辛劳的尘垢，进入造物者那恒常流动之爱的超凡美丽之中时，记得要慷慨，知晓那流经你的爱是完全富足的——完全无限制地供应着。

 

那么，这如何转译成不必担忧缺乏完美呢？我的朋友们，当一个人的确忆起自己是爱的一部分时，很多东西便开始脱落了。带着这些想法工作，对自我保持耐心。我们相信有一天，你会回首并说：「嗯，是的，我相信自己能感受这个不同并看见进展了。」无论如何，不去期待你会变得更好，而是单纯地把心和意转向无限造物者；祂的造物表达其爱之本质。

 

那些树木现在已枝繁叶茂、在你们每个人经过时提供氧气，正如当你呼吸时，也提供了叶子生长所需的二氧化碳。这种生命对生命的相互关系是多么有爱和完整呀！那是爱在爱中反射，一次一次、又一次。名为耶稣的导师说过：「让你的光在人前闪耀吧，于是人们看见造物者，而非你。」这个器皿提醒我们刚刚是在意译。让你的光、那流经你的光在所有人面前闪耀，同时记得享受那倾泻穿越你的光。

 

我们感谢你们允许我们发言，我们感谢这个器皿。我们会在此刻转移到名为(某某)的实体那里，以便在我们离开这个团体之前，我们可以提供一个机会给你们提问。因此，我们在爱与光中离开这个器皿。我们是Q’uo群体。

 

*（Jim**传讯）*

 

我是Q’uo，再次通过这个器皿、在爱与光中向各位致意。在此刻，我们荣幸地提供自己来回应在场者可能向我们提出的任何进一步的询问。现在有一个询问吗？

 

**提问者**：我有一个问题。恩典是如何进入到我们的生活和体验中的？

 

我是Q’uo，觉察了你的询问，我的姐妹。你们称为「恩典」的意识品质，是在每位寻求者之中被滋养的品质，因寻求者能够开放自我去觉察到所有造物之完美。因此，它同样是一个领悟的过程。你可能会在一个极度渴望的时刻，将所有预设的期待都抛到风中，成为一个中空的、可以让水流过的管子，这水于你便是恩典。圣灵的运动与你敞开的心对齐，促成那完美感、目的感、存在感和身份感全部出现，因此，你的体验即为太一造物者通过你的面庞而微笑的完美映射。

 

有另一个询问吗，我的姐妹？

 

**提问者**：非常感谢你，没了。我将会思考它。谢谢你们。

 

我是Q’uo，我们感谢你，我的姐妹。还有另一个询问吗？

 

**Carla**：我理解你所说的关于「重新思考你的优先项目」的内容，但是，从仅仅承诺去做那件事和规律冥想，到一种你在生活中能真正自如的境界，我对这种跃进感到困惑… 我不真正清楚你是怎样让其生效的——你实际上如何积极做到那点。你能给我一点光吗？

 

我是Q’uo，觉察了你的询问，我的姐妹。再次地，坚持不懈地练习忆起，就是你用来开始揭露你与一切事物的关系的手段，由此发现那关系是平衡、合一、和谐。寻求者观看、寻求、发问并多次地敲那扇理解之门，也收到多次的惊鸿一瞥，好提醒寻求者记得合一关系的存在。这种寻求就好像是自显意识心智而穿过遗忘面纱，燃烧出一条可供来回进入潜意识心智的小径；潜意识心智充满了完整感与合一感。因此，当你敲门并寻求时，当你真心坚持不懈地重复这份忆起的渴望时，你便忆起了合一的实相。这个过程以你们的用语似乎是缓慢且……

 

*（磁带第一面结束。）*

 

*（Jim**传讯）*

 

我是Q’uo，再次和这个器皿在一起。我们将继续。当你持续地寻求并提问，你会忆起并接收到合一才是你存在之实相的启示。这过程在你看来充满了错失目标的痛苦，以及重复的缓慢。不过，事实上，这个过程在我们看来是一种极生动、极剧烈、非常坚持不懈的过程，以无限之眼看待它时，它仅仅是在一眨眼之间发生的。

 

因此，当寻求者穿越黑暗的山谷——那就是你的人生——并在路上寻找光明时，建议寻求者去倚仗信念和意志是好的，它们就是那杖与杆。

 

有进一步的询问吗，我的姐妹？

 

**Carla**：只有一个小问题。或许那就是我为什么如此热爱唱歌。在我唱歌时，尤其是神圣音乐，我不知怎么说，事物似乎都感觉更美好，仿佛我正在进入那个一切事物皆圆满的地方。

 

我是Q’uo，我们将会简短地评论你的陈述。每位寻求者都会找到一条穿过遗忘面纱的独特之路，也许会发现数个途径或入口来通往圆满感，以及一个人与合一完全且绝对的连接。因此，每个寻求者确实都传导着一种或多或少被扭曲了的、并由该实体自身人格所塑造的生命经验。因此，每段旅程都从每一个方向上快速地返家、前往合一的中心。

 

有进一步的询问吗？

 

**Carla**：没了，Q’uo，非常感谢你们。

 

我是Q’uo，我们再次感谢你，我的姐妹。此刻有另一个询问吗？

 

*（暂停）*

 

我是Q’uo，看起来我们已经暂时耗尽所有询问了。在我们离开这个器皿和团体之前，我们希望向名为(某某)的实体提供我们的调节式振动，如果这个实体乐意的话，我们会通过该器皿说出我们的身份，接着说一些话。那么，我们会在此刻将这个通讯转移给名为(某某)的实体。我们是Q’uo。

 

*（暂停）*

 

我是Q’uo，再次与这个器皿同在。我们感觉在调节振动去适应新器皿上还有工作要做，由于这个实体已经得到某种让新器皿感到更舒适的调节，此刻我们将离开这个团体，并允许这个名为 Oxal 的复合体来结束这次集会。于是我们在太一[祂是一切]的爱与光中向这个团体告别。一切都是爱，一切来自爱的东西都是由光所刻画的。Adonai。我们是Q’uo群体。

 

我是Oxal。在无限造物者的爱与光中致意。你们可能注意到，这个实体对于我们的信号强度接收起来有些困难；然而，名为(某某)的实体觉得它非常舒适，这是我们来到这里的原因。我们想望完结这场集会并鼓励每个人都能毫无保留地发现自己的价值，因为无限之爱只能通过一个足够舒适地对那爱开启通道的人而闪耀。被忧虑所牵绊的心，很难对那种恒久存在的爱敞开。如果每个人都能把内在自我描绘为一个需要拥抱的小孩，这会帮助每个人变得能够去爱一切万有。**那些在成功爱上自己之前就尝试去做服务工作的人，发现他们很难触及那股无限之流，反而燃尽了自己、变得灵性枯竭**。你们每一位都被爱着，你们的确真实地居住在那爱之中。找到那个中心才是请求的重点，并且如果可能的话，每天都请求才好。我们现在转移到名为(某某)的器皿。我们是Oxal群体。

 

*（？传讯）*

 

我是Oxal。我们谈到的爱——对内在小孩的爱——那是一种靠近造物者之心的爱。如同你们会对任何其他人抱有悲悯一样地对待这个内在小孩吧。我们现在离开这个器皿，我们会转移返回到名为(某某)的器皿。我是Oxal。

 

*（Jim**传讯）*

 

我再次与这个器皿同在。我是Oxal。当你开始习惯去关照你的自我、那个内在小孩时，每一位都可能——仿佛第一次那般——开始觉察到那个普遍的、作为你们共同真相的内在小孩，因为那个载着你四处移动、想着属世的思维并在这幻象中运转的东西，并非自我的尽头。的确，你可以将自己考虑为拥有两种生命形态：一种是第二密度的动物，它忠实地服务并承载意识，为自我而思考和做出决定；另一种是无局限与无限的大我，也即你所是的、也是所有其他人所是的意识——它加入了前一种生命形态。

 

(宇宙)有一个意识。不过，由于自由意志，那个意识以一种独特的方式在你里内表达。正如那个小孩被关照到，那种对意识真正所是的觉察，也被关照到了。它生于每个人的内在。那个灵性自我必须被养育和关照，因为它很年轻。你们每个人，在某种意义上，都是老灵魂。另一方面，在每个人要面对的第三密度课程的意义上，每个人都是新的、且未经考验的灵魂，刚开始觉察自我，刚开始觉察存在的真实本质，并且非常饥渴地想要更多。不过，这是一个脆弱的孩子，而它生活在有时不友好的氛围中。因此，钟爱那个内在的身份，并且知晓那些单凭信心就能让人有所了解的事物吧。一切皆好。一切都将是好的，而且命运将会把你所需的残酷又甜蜜的课程带给你，好让你成长。转向太阳——它即是爱——辉煌地绽放吧！

 

在我们也要离开这个器皿之际，祝福每一个人。我们把你们留在爱与光中，留在对彼此和意识本身的照料中。我的朋友们，你们不是孤单的。Adonai，Adonai。我们是Oxal群体。

Sunday Meditation



September 5, 1993



**Group question**: The question today has to do with how we open ourselves to the awareness of non-dedication to an outcome. When we do anything during a day, whether it’s attempt to apply a spiritual principle to a situation, or earn money, or reflect upon ourselves—anything that we do—we tend to have a yardstick by which we measure the outcome, so that we set ourselves up with expectations for how the things shall be done and the final product that we produce. So, we’re aware that if we can achieve the non-dedication to the outcome—open ourselves to whatever comes through our experience—that things tend to turn out a whole lot better than we could ever imagine. And when we put expectations on outcomes, then we tend to find that our experience isn’t so harmonious, and we tend to judge ourselves. So we would like to know something about how to open ourselves to the awareness of acceptance of any situation and any process that we find ourselves in.



*(Carla channeling)*



We are those of Q’uo. Greetings in the love and the light of the one infinite Creator. It is a privilege and a blessing to be called to this session of working to share our service with you. We are humbly thankful and are happy, indeed, to share our opinions and experiences. We do, however, request that as we are not those with perfect authority, but rather seekers of truth such as you are, that each here present use his own discrimination in listening and taking to heart that which each hears. We would not be a stumbling block before any. With this understood, may we say that this particular session of working is a real treat for us, as each present brings something new to the vibratory patterns which we have become more and more familiar with through what you would call the passage of time. We thank each. And so, to our subject.



Picture, if you will, the tree in the early spring. It has been bare of all foliage except a few dead leaves for the long sleep of winter. As the air and earth gradually thaw, there is created within the living tree that life-giving food which pours upward and outward from the tree’s roots, systematically feeding and encouraging growth in the whole tree with all of its members. As each bud begins to be distinct and to show its tiny head on each limb of each part of the great trunk of the tree, does each leaf consider what it shall do? Each small creation, each bud, being of second density, has full unconsciousness awareness of the perfection of the enormously complex process of developing the leaflet to the leaf, and the process occurs perfectly.



When third density begins, those entities which have been individuated from second density and are harvested to third density receive great gifts, whereas before, all awareness and knowledge was unconscious but full. So now, third density offers the gift of self-consciousness, of self-awareness, but there is a balancing gift as well, and that is that a veil is dropped between the conscious and the unconscious minds or levels of mind, so that there is no longer that perfect unconscious awareness of the perfection of processes which is occurring. The third density, then, is one which begins with the unconscious mind completely opaque.



Among your peoples, those entities which have by choice or by geographical design been left to form societies which are simple have been more successful in reaching a recommitted relationship with what we could call destiny, so that the attitude toward good and seemingly bad things remains one of cooperation and acceptance. However, a great majority of people within your culture do not lead and do not have the obvious opportunity to lead, simple lives—the life small enough to be lived in one place with the small tasks not associated with the earning of your money. These tasks become luxuries, and entities choose under great pressures to do so, to have ambitions and to pursue these ambitions, whether they be within the world of material supply or intellectual advancement or spiritual seeking.



The basic attitude is often that which seems obviously to be at work in the processes of the educating of the self throughout the school years—to read, to do, to learn, to gather, to amass, to become more aware. These ambitions create tremendous complexity. To relocate so that the living of the complex lifestyle is possible while retaining the attitude of one who lives a simple life is a seeking which is, we would say, close to universal among those entities who have consciously chosen to pursue the living of a life by faith rather than by words.



The one known as Jesus was a teacher whose words often addressed the process of choosing to be a pilgrim, seeker or disciple of truth during a busy incarnation. This entity often suggested the very difficult possibility—to look at, to choose—of actually becoming the whole and complete pilgrim, giving away all things of the world except one outfit of clothing, not worrying about money, taking to the road … And this is one good way to begin to simplify one’s worldly, shall we say, concerns. However, the effects of an ethos or “cultural type” are subtle, and into any chosen lifestyle, no matter what its seeming simplicity, the cultural pressures to think along certain paradigms almost inevitably create as much complexity revolving around what this entity would call “chopping wood and carrying water” as they would create for a professional person with extended responsibilities. In other words, although choosing a simpler lifestyle may seem to aid in the development of a more harmonious attitude, any outer, physically described circumstance offers only the potential for such results. In each case, it is the mind of the seeker which creates that which it desires by desiring it.



What is the process of desiring? One, perhaps, could describe desire as “a falling in love with.” Certainly, the desires of the heart are deeply felt and etched with the pen of love. The yearning for that centered, flowing, effortless living which each seeker has experienced at certain times is constant, and sometimes nearly overwhelming. How the seeker yearns to feel wholly connected with the wellsprings of life, light, love and truth! It is within each seeker’s ability to so discipline the thoughts and the attitudes that, more and more, there is an increased potential for returning to a centered position of heart and mind, within which a true simplification of the improving of the centered stance is achieved.



Let us ask another question: What is each seeker’s process of perception, for this question is the beginning of a more interesting way of approaching becoming that centered entity which each wishes to become. The processes of perception are enormously many. In order to perceive anything, the five physical senses are, at all times when an entity is awake, sending millions, literally millions, of bits of information all the time to that biocomputer which you call the brain. Your brain uses programming which it began receiving before coming out of the womb. In order to prioritize the incoming data, perhaps one or two percent of the combined total of all sense information is actually chosen for use in any moment, and the rest is stored in that very, very spacious storage which you may call the brain. Therefore, if an entity wishes to alter the attitude, it is a good idea, we feel, to address the question of what sense data achieves the priority to be considered by the conscious mind as the moments fly by.



How can a seeker communicate with that unconscious portion of the mind which filters sense perceptions? The entity simply communicates with that portion of the self. The beginning of this communication is silent meditation. This is different for each entity. Some are refreshed by one method of silent listening, another by a second, and so forth. Each path is good for that one entity; each is unique. To improve that communication, then, the beginning is to meditate in your own unique way, to be faithful to the remembering each in your own way. For you see, it is remembering who you are to sit in meditation for a few moments, and within that silence, however imperfectly you may feel you are keeping that silence, you are doing the equivalent of knocking at that door to the subconscious or deeper mind and saying, “Yes, I am ready for material from you, I hope, in this way, in this set of emotions and attitudes with which I come questing to this silence.” And the deep mind hears and understands, and one more small step has been taken to move the seat of living from the brain and its intellectual circumstances to the heart, with its lack of justification and its purity of feeling, for the true wisdom lies within the emotions which are progressively purified by focus.



Once the habits have been set and experiences have been had of that feeling of life flowing freely, the feeling then can be, not created, but accessed by the seeker with more and more grace and ease, with simple repetitive—we correct this instrument—repetitive practice, for what you seek to be whole is already there, as each is truly aware. It is an allowing of that feeling to be there that is needed, an allowing that calls to your processes of perception and says, “I want information about love in this moment. Where is it? I want to be there working cooperatively with these energies.”



We know that each will be self-disappointed many times. We encourage each to consider that this, too, is a lovely portion of a process by which change within is achieved for each grain of transformation, each new ability to choose spiritually based information rather than other priorities. Some that were priorities will be lost, and as the heart and mind change their habits, that which is old and stale must fall away. This is perceived as painful.



Consequently, what we are saying is that along with the flow of living life cooperatively with destiny, there is a continuing discomfort which comes from changing faster than other entities because that is what you wish to do. However, it is a simple choice to make for most who prefer being awake and in the conscious presence of the Infinite to being those who are asleep in a dream within the dream of incarnation itself, and do not ask themselves to do aught except flow along the lines of the society.



We do encourage each not only to partake in this speeding up process of conscious living, but we encourage and exhort each to find within the attitude a growing awareness of how love felt within is a channel through which the infinite love of the Creator may flow to others. Let that light within be. Let the self open and flow consciously, so that you may be part of the good in the lives of those whom you touch. Sometimes it is nothing more than a supportive smile to a stranger that makes the difference for that stranger that particular moment. As you are given grace to lift away from the stains of sorrow and toil into the ethereal beauty of that ever flowing love which is the Creator, remember to be generous, and know that that which comes through you is in utter abundance—completely unlimited in supply.



How, then, does this translate to not worrying about lacks of perfection? My friends, when one does remember that one is a portion of love, much begins to fall away. Work with these thoughts and be patient with the self. We believe you may one day look back and say, “ Why yes, I believe I can feel the difference and see the progress.” However, do not look for your getting better, but simply turn the heart and mind towards the infinite Creator, Whose creation expresses Its loving nature.



The trees now are in full leaf offering oxygen to each of you as you pass them offering to them, as you breathe, the carbon dioxide which the leaves need to grow. How loving and complete are the interrelationships of life to life! It is love reflected in love, over and over and over. The teacher known as Jesus said, “Let your light so shine before men that the Creator is seen, not you.” We paraphrase, this instrument is reminding us. Let your light—let that light which flows through you—shine before all, and remember to enjoy that light as it pours through you.



We thank you for allowing us to speak, and we thank this instrument. We would at this time, transfer to the one known as (name) that we may offer questions an opportunity to be asked before we leave this group. Thusly, we do leave this instrument in love and light. We are those of Q’uo.



*(Jim channeling)*



I am Q’uo, and greet each again in love and in light through this instrument. At this time, it is our privilege to offer ourselves for any further query which those present may have for us. Is there a query at this time?



**Questioner**: I have a question. How does grace come into our lives and into our experience?



I am Q’uo, and am aware of your query, my sister. The quality of consciousness which you would call “grace” is that quality that is nurtured in each seeker, as the seeker is able to open itself to the awareness of the perfection of all creation. Thus, it is also a process of realization. You may, in a moment of great desire, fling all predetermined expectations to the wind and become as hollow as the pipe through which the water moves, and this water for you is grace. The movement of the Spirit aligning with your open heart causes the feeling of perfection, purpose, place and identity with all to occur, so that your experience is the perfect reflection of the one Creator smiling through your face.



Is there another query, my sister?



**Questioner**: Thank you very much, but no. I’ll think about that. Thank you.



I am Q’uo, and we thank you, my sister. Is there another query?



**Carla**: I’m having trouble moving from … I understand what you’re saying about, “re-think what your priorities are,” but moving from just a commitment to doing that and a commitment to regular meditation, to a place in life where you really are OK with letting things be … I’m not real clear on how you put that into effect—how you actually, positively do that. Could you give me some light here?



I am Q’uo, and am aware of your query, my sister. Again, the persistent practice of remembering is that means whereby you begin to uncover your relationship to all things, discovering that that relationship is balance, is unity, is harmony. The seeker looks and seeks and asks and knocks many times at the door of understanding, and receives many times a glimpse to remind the seeker that there is a relationship of unity. This seeking is like unto moving from the conscious mind through that veil of forgetting, blazing a trail that can be traveled backward and forward into the subconscious mind which is full of the feeling of wholeness and unity. Thus, as you knock and seek, and repeat in heartfelt persistence this desire to remember, so do you remember that reality of unity. The process in your terms seems slow and …



*(Side one of tape ends.)*



*(Jim channeling)*



I am Q’uo, and am again with this instrument. We shall continue. As you continue to seek and to ask, so do you remember and receive the inspiration of that wholeness that is the true reality of your being. The process is filled, it would seem to you, with the pain of missing the mark, the slowness of repetition. Yet, in truth, this process is seen by us to be one of great vividness, great intensity, and great persistence, occurring in but the blink of an eye when seen from the eye of infinity.



Thus, the seeker is well counseled to depend upon the faith and the will—the rod and the staff—as it moves through that valley of darkness that is your incarnation, seeking the light upon the way.



Is there a further query, my sister?



**Carla**: Just one small one. Perhaps that’s why I really love to sing so much. I do find sometimes when I’m singing, especially sacred music, that—I don’t know, things sort of feel better, as if I am accessing that place where everything is whole.



I am Q’uo, and we shall comment briefly upon your comment. It is so that each seeker shall find an unique pathway through the veil of forgetting, and perhaps shall discover a number of avenues or entrances to the feeling of wholeness and one’s complete and absolute connection to that unity. Thus does each entity channel a life experience distorted in more or less degree, and fashioned by the uniqueness of its own personality. Thus, each journey proceeds apace from every direction homeward to the center of unity.



Is there a further query?



**Carla**: No, Q’uo, thank you very much.



I am Q’uo, and again we thank you, my sister. Is there another query at this time?



*(Pause)*



I am Q’uo, and it appears that we have exhausted the queries for the nonce. Before we take our leave of this instrument and this group, we would wish to offer our conditioning vibration to the one known as (name), and if this entity is willing we would speak our identification through its instrument and speak a few sentences following. We would at this time, then, transfer this contact to the one known as (name). We are those of Q’uo.



*(Pause)*



I am Q’uo, and am again with this instrument. We feel that there is the work for us to do in adjusting our vibrations to those of the new instrument, and at this time we would leave this group and allow the complex known as Oxal to close this session of working, for this entity has already achieved some adjustment which allows more comfort to the new instrument. Consequently, we would bid this group hail and farewell, in the love and light of the One which is All. That All is Love, and all that comes from It is etched by light. Adonai. We are those of Q’uo.



I am Oxal. Greetings in the love and in the light of the infinite Creator. This instrument, you may note, has some difficulty with the strength of our signal; however, the one known as (name) finds it very comfortable, and this is why we are here. We wish to close this session encouraging each to put value in the self without reservation, for the love that is infinite can only shine through an entity which is comfortable enough to open a channel to that love. The heart engaged in clinging to concern has more difficulty opening to the love which is always present. If each could picture the inner self as a child which needs a hug, it would aid each in becoming able to love all that is. Those who attempt to do service work before they have successfully fallen in love with the self find themselves unable to access that flow which is infinite, and instead find themselves burning out and becoming exhausted spiritually. You are loved, each of you, and it is in that love that you truly reside. Finding that center is truly a matter of asking, and the asking is well to do each day if possible. We would now transfer to the one known as (name). We are those of Oxal.



*(? channeling)*



I am Oxal. The love that we spoke of—the love of the inner child—is one which is close to the heart of the Creator. Have compassion for this inner child as you would any other. We leave this instrument now, and would transfer back to the one known as (name). I am Oxal.



*(Jim channeling)*



I am again with this instrument. I am Oxal. As you begin to become used to ministering to your self, to that inner child, may each become aware, as if for the first time, of the universal inner child that is your common truth, for that which carries you about, thinks the thoughts of the world, and functions within the illusion is not the end of the self. Indeed, you may think of yourself as having two life forms: the second-density animal which faithfully serves and carries consciousness, thinks and makes decisions for the self is joined by the unlimited and infinite Self, which is the consciousness which is you and is also all others.



There is one consciousness. Yet, due to free will, that consciousness expresses within you in an unique way. As the little child is cared for, so is that awareness of what consciousness truly is. It is born within each. That spiritual self must be nurtured and cared for, for it is young. Each of you is, in one sense, an old soul. In another, in the sense that each is facing the lessons of third density, each is a new and untried spirit, newly conscious of self, newly conscious of the true nature of existence, and very hungry for more. Yet, this is a fragile child, and it exists in sometimes inhospitable climes. Therefore, love that inner identity and know those things that faith alone can give knowledge of. All is well. All will be well, and destiny will bring every harsh and sweet lesson which you need in order to grow. Turn to the sun which is love, and bloom gloriously.



Blessings to each as we, too, leave through this instrument. We leave you in love and in light, and in the care of each other and consciousness itself. My friends, you are not alone. Adonai. Adonai. We are those of Oxal.
