周日冥想，2001年3月4日

**团体问题**：我们今天的问题是，如果一个人拥有大量可用的、来自红色光芒的性欲能量，却没有性伴侣，那么此人如何能够允许那股能量尽可能以最和谐的方式流经身体的各个能量中心呢？

*(Carla传讯)*

我们是你们认识的 Q'uo 原则，在太一无限造物者的爱与光中致意。我们感谢你们各位在今天呼唤我们来到这个团体。我们为你们的探寻而感谢你们，感谢你们的问题。我们乐于回应一些我们的想法和意见。你们的职责就是使用自己的分辨力，并认识到我们绝不是权威而是道途上的朝圣者，我们乐于跟你们分享自己的体验。我们的分享是灵魂对灵魂、生命对生命的分享；就教与学而言，我们觉得你们是我们的老师，在更大程度上超过了我们是你们的老师。我们大大地感激这种教与学的交流。我们感谢大家、祝福大家，因为我们全都渴望服务、全都渴望寻求真理，这个纽带赐福给我们彼此的同伴情谊。

你们今天问到关于红色光芒能量的事，我们很高兴谈论这个有趣的主题。如我们经常遇到的情况，我们想要借由下述做法来确立那个让我们能(深入)讨论的地基：后退一步，不只查看红色光芒能量中心，还要查看能量体及其在肉体上的位置以及能量体与肉体的连接。

首先，我们会断定每个实体都是一个菁华，一个在许多不同层面上有着复杂特征的能量场。一个灵魂的菁华振动着——其振动贯穿所有的密度——并在内在层面的所有七个形体中都有脉轮的连接，所以当一个人在考虑能量体时，此人并不是在简单地考量肉体的一个附属物，毋宁说是在考量一个能量场系统，这个系统远远延伸超越时间、空间、此生的情况。所以，能量体与肉体的关系，并不像你线性地考虑与各种脉轮能量有关的问题时所看见的表象那么直接。

能量体是一个由占据了——用你们的术语——相同空间和时间的诸多形体所构成的系统，因为这些形体全都是在此生中、潜在可用的资讯来源，于是，随着一个实体变得越来越熟悉能量体处于平衡状态的感觉，就会出现一种回馈系统；在致力于平衡该(能量体)系统的过程中，这个回馈系统是大大有帮助的。我们稍后将更多地讨论这点。

这个器皿倾向于将能量按照脉轮来分类、根据脉轮来源来分析它们，这肯定也是很多与脉轮中心这概念一同工作的实体之倾向。在一些情况中，这方式具备额度有限的帮助。有时候问题出在脉轮被堵住了或被过度激活了，那就相当有可能从脉轮起源来分析情况。然而，这种注视或分析脉轮能量的方式，其局限在于：**脉轮并非分开工作的，毋宁说，它们是作为一个系统在运作的**，另外，随着「借由信心来学习、借由信心来接受」这个过程继续下去，脉轮在更高密度中的不同精微体之间有着重要且有显著意义的关联。

那么，我们会借由下述建议而开始(谈论)，建议是：**在面对你感知到的能量体中的不平衡时，最好认识到，不管情况也许显得有多局部，它都是非局部性的**.**也就是说，也许看起来红色光芒出现了过度活跃或阻塞，然后导致了红色光芒失去能量。实际上，该系统里的能量很少只在一种光芒中受阻，因为各种光芒之间都有相互关系，尤其是在几个主要光芒之间，而且对那些工作服务他人极性的实体来说，心轮特别重要.**

举例来说，在被感知到的红色脉轮阻塞的情况中，仔细地观察红色光芒的特性，这么做是好的。它是能量体的第一道大门入口。它是允许太一造物者的无限能量进入的第一道大门。检视能量系统的简单方式就是：查看那些阻塞，一个接一个地消除它们。然而，每个脉轮的微妙性超越了各自的指定位置或地点。也就是说，就线性的意义而言，红色光芒的阻塞肯定与性欲有关，但就很重要的非线性意义而言，它更多地与生存方面的爱和恐惧有关。对一个吃得饱、穿得暖、头上有屋顶遮蔽头顶的人来说，生存是个至关重要却隐蔽的议题。清醒的意识不会想到性欲问题跟生存有关，因为就生存而言，性欲清清楚楚不是必需的。然而，在通往形而上形体或能量体的那道大门中，一个人也在凝视通往肉体的那道大门，而且，这种在形而上形体与肉体之间的关联会创造出如下情境：肉体的本能会产生一种有时引人注目、同时又隐蔽的效应在那份被感知到的红色光芒阻塞体验上，所以那个被感知为性欲挫折的东西实际上是内心想要生存的哭喊。

这个器皿早些时候正谈论着「满足个人需要」这一简单又根本的必要性。明显地，在你们的投生经历中，自我川流不息地提出要求——关于生存所需品。肚子呼喊着食物，肉体迫切需要繁衍，身体要求呼吸、工作、移动、发挥功能，等等。当大门通道上有持续存在的挑战，比如否认自己所感知到的性需要，这就会让能量系统在某些线路上变得堵塞，给正在体验的灵魂造成红色光芒堵塞的感知。在这份观察的层次上，这(感知)是正确的。而在这份观察之解决方案的层次上——如果有一个解决方案的话——这是不正确的。

因为，正如我们说过的，脉轮之间的关联以及一个脉轮对另一个脉轮的影响，比起这个器皿和很多人所认定的、为能量体所拥有的要多得多。所以事实上，红色光芒的堵塞，就最线性的意义而言，确实会妨碍能量流动，于是能量上升不到心轮，从而不能被意识内的工作所用。但更主要的是，这是一股非物质的能量，既不是性能量、也不是生存的能量，它就是能量。事实上，你看，能量体并不回应肉体刺激。就能量的意义而言，身体完全是心智、灵性、情绪的创造物。所以，那些内在的感觉、那些欲望和渴求——与其通常的状态一样复杂又互有关联——实际上其核心都是一种位于能量体之内的阻塞。由于具肉身的生命之需求是复杂的，堵塞、过度激活以及能量体内的其他扭曲，这些远比可用智力心智来分析判定的东西复杂。

我们会建议处理能量体内的阻塞的一种方式是：把有关于能量体清理或平衡的资源给予自我——我们曾经通过这个器皿谈过这点。既然我们以前讲过，这里就扼要概述一下：**能量平衡的要点是，在一天结束时安静地坐下来，在反思中简单地逐个回忆当天的经历，花时间回顾你在当天收获的情绪中记得的每个扭曲，不管这个扭曲是寻求者所感知到的正面或负面情绪。因为所有失衡的扭曲都同样可以帮助你观察扭曲、把你带入冥想性心智的场地，好让你在静默中释放控制，于是那些环绕、守卫、指引每位寻求者的无形存有的可用帮助，就可以被允许进入该能量系统了.**

这个器皿很少用这种方法来工作她自己的能量平衡，因为**这种技巧涉及检视每一个情绪并允许它强化到相当强烈的地步，然后允许该情绪的反面进入该等式，直到能够平衡地看待两边****——****比如说不耐心与耐心****——****为止.**然而，这个器皿确实使用一种观想技巧以平衡其能量。这技巧有助于下述实体：他们的观想能力比较迟钝，以至于不存在情绪过度强化或过度戏剧化之危险——这会扫除取得平衡的可能性.**在这种观想技巧中，你可以单纯地请求指导****(****灵)****的帮助，确定跟指导(****灵)****联系以后，请求指导(****灵)****帮助自己以内在的或直觉的方式，检查脉轮中心的实际颜色，看看它们是否具有相同的色调、颜色强度，每个颜色的亮度是否相同，这样就可以直觉地看见，一个能量中心是不是显得混浊、暗黑、虚弱或稀薄.**

**使用平衡冥想或者使用观想技巧来与平衡技巧一同工作，都是可能的。这两种技巧都给能量体发出信号：你正在照料该身体，这关怀是发自内心的；这极其令身体放心并且有帮助****——****不管平衡式冥想或观想从显意识的立场来看是否成功.**

**另一个可以很好地帮助疏通障碍的面向是完全顺着已出现的情绪行动。我们的意思是：寻求者尽可能准确找出已出现的基本情绪，然后把它表达出来**。在R实体提到并涉及到、P实体说到的情况中，那经验是在夜里从睡眠中醒来后，立刻感到极度的烦躁，以至于到了想尖叫的地步。这种感觉出现的时候，我们会鼓励你到一个安全的地方叫喊。打扰他人是不明智的，打扰环境也是不明智的。然而，在不侵犯他人自由意志、不损坏自己内在任何东西的情况下，承认并表达(自己的)情绪，则是明智的。承认原始痛苦，表达痛苦，即使是诸如尖叫这样最为原始的情绪释放，这些做法都有真正的灵性价值，因为它是发自内心想生存的尖叫，而不只是由于身体想要繁殖或表达性欲。这是该能量扭曲的表面，而非其菁华。造成能量扭曲的表面催化剂跟(实际)产出能量扭曲的催化剂，几乎从未是线性匹配的。因为在能量体里面，一系列无意识的记忆联结以及前世记忆是为数众多的，包含着与这个议题的关系，或者与那个正在给这个议题提供催化剂的实体的关系。所以，理性心智在显意识状态下，不能够明显看透实际的能量扭曲具备什么特性。

**也许我们可以说，在超出某一点以后，倚靠信心是好的**。我们总是返回至这情况的单纯性与合一，因为所有的能量都是一。那儿没有性能量、个人能量、家庭和集体能量，没有心能量，等等。随着能量流经这些能量中心和各个能量体之间的连接，能量有了不同的面向、颜色[容我们说]。但是，能量本身是无限制的白光，并且尽管它可能在自身阴影中被扭曲——这些阴影位于能量性的肉体的连接之中、能量体本身之中以及问题的源头处——但它全然是相同的能量.**我们觉得，这是一个关键的概念。因为这点将寻求者提升超越她的问题的概念局限，并把等待的心和正在聆听心的能量体放置在一个觉察到更大图景的情况中。接着清醒心智接受的东西就变成通往潜在解决方案的大门，这个解决方案等着你找到它，把它从束缚中释放出来.**

**首先，要有一切都好的信心.**对于一个正在受苦的人，这是意义重大的一步，因为肉体想以基于恐惧的方式而反应。肉体的本能就是为了自身安全而保护和控制。所以人们感到不舒服的时候，就觉得需要控制这个情况。一个人需要获致一个舒适区。然而，在你们的密度中，你作为一个寻求者在投生之前经常已经做出选择，这些选择把你放置于一个情况，在其中，你将持续地受苦；那就是你过去打算做的.**你在投生前没有把这过程看成受苦。这种情况会被视为学习。它被视为缔造突破的大好机会，是灵性生命在进化路上往前迈进的一步。进化就是改变。改变是困难的。改变很痛苦，改变会产生苦难，所以你观察到，自己体验的某些障碍是你投生前就放在那里的；不是为了快速地突破它们，而是为了启动自我接纳、自我理解、自我宽恕的过程。这过程远比该议题深入许多，而该议题开始了这个理解、接纳、治愈、宽恕的过程.**

**其次，要有这样的信心：在理性心智可得的帮助之外还有别的帮助，这种帮助是良性的、善意的，而且是智能的。一旦你有了「信心」这个基本态度，相信不管表面情况如何，一切都好，那你就在心里打开了一扇门**；**恐惧曾经关闭这扇门，还会一次又一次地继续想要关闭它。这就是为什么每日冥想和进入静默是如此重要，即使只有一会儿**。那个与静默的连接会给下述资源供能：这些资源属于肉体与能量体之间的连接，以及能量体跟另外一些相关形体之连接——当你的高我前来第三密度帮助你时，那些形体在高我的指引之中会被涉及.**对于一切都好的信心，对于帮助就在那里的信心，加在一起就有一种惊人的安慰和强化的效果.**然而，如我们说过的一样，在面对持续一段时间的、明显的肉体不平衡的过程中，这种幸福感会一次又一次被肉体载具本能的、以恐惧为基础的反应所连累，肉体载具会感觉到自己在生存能力方面正在受威胁。

如这个器皿说过的，没有其他议题比红色光芒更棘手了，因为那种天然的机能在肉体中是如此强健，并且人们对关系和友谊的感情需要是如此极为强烈，而性欲是满足该需要的门户。当肉体的性欲本能被否定时，任何人肯定都没法控制并——借由做或不做某种实际行动——解决肉体的不适。在这种情况下就会出现某种程度的痛苦，视个人的特性和能量系统而定。对某些实体来说这根本微不足道、不会注意到的，或是小事一桩。对于其他实体来说，这是很庞大、很实质的问题，肯定无法被忽视。这个器皿知道P实体说过，独自一人机械性地满足身体的性欲，不管重复多少次都不令人满足，我们对此并不吃惊，因为**事实上，性能量障碍其实不是它看起来的样子，而是深沉得多、重大得多的折磨，它会延伸到能量体的整个身体系统，如果不只是肉体的话.**

在很基本的意义上，我们必须说，据我们所知，所有人都有受苦的时候，总有些似乎很重要但不被满足的需要；行星地球这所「爱的学校」就是这样运作的。因为一次又一次地，它会允许肉体感官告知智力：东西是不够的，没有安全，没有疗愈.**对于灵性导向的实体而言，其挑战是：注视着身体受限又迫切的种种需要时，不着眼于解决，而是着眼于爱与理解，进入到体验之中，进入受苦之中，进入这情况引起的所有情绪之中，并看见该自我****——****它处于其需要之中、处于其欲求之中、处于由那些饥饿的呼唤所定义的特性之中。对于发展中的灵魂而言，一个人所渴望的事物是极度有趣的，注视一个人渴望的事物是什么，这是很好的，不是着眼于评判，而是带着完全拥抱自我的希望，带着爱上那个正在受苦的自我的希望，带着在心中轻轻摇晃那个自我的希望，并说：「是的，这些需要是美丽的，这些需要是有价值的；这些需要是完全可接受的，这些需要单纯是因为我的生活环境才没有被满足。」**

**一次又一次，以这样或那样的方式，这即是处于物质层面内的寻求者的情况：东西不够，没有疗愈，就只有受苦。这是一幅暗黑的图画，并且我们会对你们说，它跟土壤本身一样黑暗。在脚下的泥土是黑暗的。它是暗黑的、神秘的、具有生育力的。它是某个事物的种子，它将通过泥土、通过受苦、通过痛苦点而成长，最终以各种方式绽放，这些方式在受苦正被体验的时刻是无法被领会的。也许你可以把这幅图画看成拼图，你离这幅拼图太近，所以只看到了两千片拼图中的三十五片，所以问题看起来像是关于一条狗或一个人。但是如果你退后一步来观察整幅图画，人和狗处在一个大得多的冲突的边缘，这个冲突包括的特征和议题要多很多。在一个痛苦周期结束之后，事后检视该模式，说：「对，我明白这个折磨的意义，明白这个催化剂给我提供的要点。我看见它把我带到什么地方，我学会了什么东西，我很感激」，这样就容易得多。我们现在建议：事前就凭借信心而采取感激、感谢该痛苦的态度，让你在备受折磨时可以释放控制，对自己说出自己的需要，然后放手。这就承认了：超越所有的需要、超越所有的能量扭曲、超越所有的痛苦和局限，自我的菁华是完美的，安歇在最神圣的爱中，安歇在最强健又有疗愈力的光中.**

我们要在此时将这个通讯转移给Jim实体。我们感谢这个器皿提供自己作为管道，我们感谢这个团体提出这个很有趣的问题。我们在爱与光中离开这个器皿并在此时转移。我们是 Q'uo 群体。

*（Jim**传讯）*

我是 Q'uo ，通过这个器皿、再次于爱与光中向各位致意。我们在此刻很荣幸提供自己来尝试谈论这个团体可能给我们的任何进一步询问。此刻有另一个询问吗？

**S**：我开始吧。我感到好奇的事情是：当我们每周聚集在一起的时候，我们会谈论我们在过去的一周做了什么事，我想我应该给你们机会跟我们讲讲你们上周过的如何。

我是 Q'uo ，觉察了你的询问，我的兄弟。自从上一次加入这个团体，我们拥有的体验是探索自我的内部事物，容我们说。这是我们逐渐成为太一造物者的方法。我们在可能被视为很小的步伐中继续沿着自己的进化道途前进，调查自己的那些部分[属于造物者]，我们在过去的经历中对那些部分赏识得不足，容我们说。当然，我们在(任何)可能的地方进入服务他人。在大多数情况中，这种服务大部分是出现在那些我们设法服务的对象的梦中。是故，在我们的工作和服务中，成果不算太多。

此刻有另一个询问吗？

**S**：在此刻，有任何我们任何其他的无形朋友的讯息吗？

我是 Q'uo ，觉察了你的询问，我的兄弟。那些天军，如我们听过它有此称呼，仅仅向所有那些可接受爱与光的人们送出其爱与光。

有另一个询问吗，我的兄弟？

**S**：现在没了。谢谢。

我是 Q'uo ，我们感谢你，我的兄弟。在此刻有另一个询问吗？

**R**：我从不记得在梦境中觉察到 Q'uo 。你们是否更多地在一个能量层面上这么做，而非以一个身份出现？

我是 Q'uo ，觉察了你的询问，我的兄弟。当我们能够做这样的访问时，最经常的情况是：我们寻求去服务的那个人，发现自己处于你们称为险峻海峡的困境中，由于忍受不了生活中遭遇的磨难和痛苦，正在呼救。在这种极度需要的情况下，我们有时候就能够出席，以令人鼓舞的形式被这种实体感觉到。以你们的术语说，这是有些罕见的，但这是我们自这个星球历史中的古老日子就开始从事的一种服务手段。

有另一个询问吗，我的兄弟？

**R**：没有。没问题了。只有感谢你们的回答。因为知道我们全都有无形的帮助，使我得到某种安慰。

我是 Q'uo ，我们感谢你，我的兄弟。在此刻有另一个询问吗？

**S**：最近与我们一起工作的女人，她的母亲去世了。今天我嫂子的父亲非常接近死亡，我想要知道有没有任何言语或想法或观念是我可以和他们分享，以帮助他们度过正在经历的挣扎？

我是 Q'uo ，觉察了你的询问，我的兄弟。若一个人想望服务的情况是心爱的人去世了，余生者正在遭受巨大的痛苦和悲伤，那么最佳的服务常常是单纯设法满足伤心者感到的需要。因此，如我们觉察你已经准备去做的事，通过提供食品作为一个人的服务方式，就是这些人会感激的方式，因为在这时候他们心里想的只是过世的挚爱者，别的都想不到了。如果一个人感觉到那个悲伤实体的身上有个入口，你可以向对方建议，死者已经完成了一个宏大的设计或计划，而这个层面在尘世经历以后还在继续，这里的结束是另一个层面的开始。那么，就可能有某种安慰能够给予对方的心与意以及魂。因为，提醒那些悲伤的人他们(本来)知道的事情——即所有生命都是持续的，万物都从太一造物者中跃出，我们做那些我们该做的事，在任何时候真的都不存在失去——这种对灵性旅程的基本元素的提醒经常是有帮助的且令人感激。

有进一步的询问吗，我的兄弟？

**S**：我的妻子仍因为摔破的脚踝而体验到大量的肿胀和疼痛，她请求知道是否有任何其他的课程、意义或无论什么事，她应该在此刻进一步检验？

我是 Q'uo ，觉察了你的询问，我的兄弟。当我们考虑C实体的情况时，我们会建议：她已经很好地处理来到她面前的催化剂了。剩下的治愈过程可能是既讨厌又漫长的，不过为了催化剂被最充分地利用，这是必须的。我们没看到这个实体有进一步检验心智的需要。很多人祝福过C实体早日恢复健康，我们也添加自己的祝福和治愈性振动。

此刻有另一个询问吗？

**S**：没了。谢谢你们。

我是 Q'uo 。再一次，我们感谢你，我的兄弟。此刻有另一个询问吗？

**Carla**：我想要跟进S的询问。看起来，如果你需要做一件事来解决你遇到的催化剂，它不必然会解决问题。有没有这样的情况，问题就是你所认定的，并且你在物质界中的行动很好地解决了问题？或者从抽象意义来说，情况的根源始终是隐藏的？

我是 Q'uo ，觉察了你的询问，我的姐妹。虽然我们并不想要劝阻任何人仔细检查自己注意到的催化剂的每个部分，但在显意识心智终于注意到出现在面前的催化剂时，在决定自己该行旅哪条途径的过程中，很多东西已经遗失了。这仅仅是第三密度的沉重化学幻象之性质；你们发现自己身处于该幻象中。很难清楚感知到从潜意识心智和形而上领域发送出的讯息，因为它们所讲的语言好像不一样，听到这种语言的耳朵只能模糊地感知它们的原意.**因此，最好不仅使用显意识的分析式心智，而且还睿智地运用直觉、预感、那些透过遗忘面纱而来并留下意义痕迹的感觉，****(****运用)****那种****——****我们给了这个器皿一个短语****——****细微的****方向感，这种方向是你在愿意跟随森林深处的面包屑痕迹时可以跟随的，为了再次寻找你进入这块雄伟又孤立的地区时所走的路**。

当一个人仔细检查潜意识心智的时候，容我们说，尽其所能地仔细检查，将会发现那里有参天大树，美得难以形容的蕨类植物，先前不被知晓的苔藓，奇特而异乎寻常的生物，几乎不能被呼吸的空气——不过一经吸入却是令人愉快的。因此，**当一个人检查催化剂来寻找其起源和利用方向时，一个人可以感到放心，这是一个过程，其自身是能够成为一条进入奇异王国的旅程。在这样一个地方找到的果实是完全值得努力的，无论一个人能够享用全部的大餐，还是仅仅只能享用餐前小菜.**

我的姐妹，有另一个询问吗？

**Carla**：我本来还有更多问题，但我觉得能量正在减少。如果你们想望评论的话，你们说能量体有语言的时候，我在想：那是情绪的语言吗？我做音乐或文字工作——比如写诗——或使用颜色的时候，这些元素在我看来都跟能量体很融洽，净化我的情绪，而且有助带出各种情绪。我在想，对于能量体，情绪可能比起智力分析是更好的语言。

我是 Q'uo ，觉察了你的询问，我的姐妹。我们也觉察到这个圈子的能量是低落的。我们将简短地评论。

情绪是一条探索的途径，它也值得付出大量努力。当我们建议检查直觉时，我们意指的方向是尝试诠释催化剂及其在未来行动上的应用，因为**直觉是某种更纯净的情绪、出自另一个来源，它们是潜意识心智的属性，是显意识心智对自己试图理解的潜意识语言所做的首次转译，容我们说。所以我们建议，把直觉和你建议的情绪更多地作为检查催化剂的根本手段，而非允许智力头脑成为你探索催化剂的唯一努力****(****方式)****.**

有进一步的询问吗，我的姐妹？

**Carla**：没。我真的为那个回答而感谢你们， Q'uo 。

我是 Q'uo ，我们感谢你，我的姐妹。此刻有最后一个询问吗？

*（没有进一步的询问。）*

我是 Q'uo 。我们愿利用这个机会再一次感谢各位邀请我们加入这个工作圈。我们觉察到每个人为了参加今天的集会圈都做出了巨大的努力，因为你们必须克服很多障碍才能到这里来。我们感谢每一位成为这个圈子的一部分，我们感谢你们邀请我们出席，我们感谢你们带着一颗真实且真诚的心来寻求我们的意见，而我们喜悦地给出一些意见，尽管我们推荐每个人都遵循那些让自己听到真理铃声的言语。拿走那些言语，把所有其他的都留在后面。我们是你们认识的 Q'uo ，我们会在此刻离开这个器皿和团体，一如既往，把各位留在太一无限造物者的爱与光中。Adonai，我的朋友们。Adonai。

Sunday Meditation

March 4, 2001

**Group question:** Our question today is how can a person who has a great deal of sexual energy available from the red ray but who has no sexual partner allow that energy to move through the various energy centers of the body in the most harmonious way possible?

*(Carla channeling)*

We are those known to you as the principle Q'uo. Greetings in the love and in the light of the one infinite Creator. We thank each of you who has called us to this group this day. We thank you for your searching, and we thank you for your question. We are glad to respond with our thoughts and opinions. For your part, you will use discrimination and realize that we are in no way authorities but those who are pilgrims upon the path and are glad to share what experiences we have had with you. We share as soul to soul and being to being and, in terms of learning and in terms of teaching, we feel you are our teachers to a greater extent than we are yours. We greatly appreciate this exchange of learning and of teaching. We thank each and bless each, for we are all desiring to be of service and all desiring to seek the truth. This is the bond that blesses us with its companionship, one to the other.

You ask this day concerning red-ray energy, and we are happy to talk about this interesting subject. As is often the case with us we would like to establish the ground upon which we will speak by moving back a step and looking at not just the red-ray energy center but at the energetic body and its location with regards to the physical body and its connections to the physical body.

Firstly, we would posit that each entity is an essence, a field of energy that has complex characteristics on many different levels. A soul essence vibrates through all densities and has chakra connections in all seven bodies on the inner planes, so when one is dealing with the energetic body one is dealing not simply with an adjunct to the physical body but rather a system of fields of energy that extend far past time, space and incarnational situations. Consequently, in dealing with the energetic body, the relationship of the energy body to the physical body is not as straightforward as it may seem to be when thinking in a linear fashion concerning issues connected with the various chakra energies.

The energy body is a system of bodies which occupy, in your terms, the same space and time in that they are all potentially available as sources of information within the incarnation so that as an entity becomes increasingly familiar with the feeling of the energy body in balance there becomes a kind of feedback system that is greatly helpful in working to balance the system. We will discuss this at more length later.

It is the tendency of this instrument, and certainly many who work with the concepts of the chakra centers, to tend to categorize energies as to chakra and to analyze them as to chakra source. This is in some cases of a limited amount of help. It is sometimes quite possible to analyze a situation in terms of chakra origination when it comes to blockage or over-activation. However, the limitations of this way of gazing at or analyzing chakra energies is that the chakras do not work separately, but rather work as a system and in addition have important and significant connections between finer bodies within higher densities as the process of learning by faith and receiving by faith now goes on.

We would begin then by suggestion that it is well, when faced with a perceived imbalance in the energy body, to realize that the situation is non-local, no matter how local it may seem. That is, it may seem that there is a red-ray over-activation or a red-ray blockage and that this is then removing energy from the red ray. In actuality, the energies of the system are seldom blocked in only one ray because of the interrelationships between the rays, especially between the primary rays and also because of the centrality of the heart to those who are working in service-to-others polarity.

In the case of perceived red-ray blockage, for instance, it is well to gaze carefully at the nature of red ray. It is that first gateway of the energetic body. It is that first gateway that allows in the infinite energy of the one infinite Creator. The easy way to gaze at energy systems is to look at the blockages and, one by one, to remove them. However, the subtleties of each chakra move beyond the stated venue or placement of that chakra. That is to say, certainly the red-ray blockage has to do with sexuality in a linear sense, but in a very significant non-linear sense it has far more to do with the processes of love and fear as regards survival. Survival is a vital and hidden issue for an entity that is well fed, decently clothed, warm and with a roof over the physical head. It does not occur to the waking consciousness that there is a survival issue with regards to sexuality, for sexuality is clearly not necessary for survival. However, in the gateway to the metaphysical body or energy body one also is gazing at the gateway to the physical body, and this connection between physical and metaphysical bodies creates the situation in which the instincts of the physical body have a sometimes striking and, again, hidden effect upon the perceived experience of blockage in red ray, so that that which is perceived as sexual frustration is actually the cry of the heart to survive.



This instrument was talking earlier about the simple, fundamental necessity of having one’s need met. Obviously, in terms of your experience within incarnation, there is a constant and unremitting traffic of requests from the self concerning those things which it needs to survive. The stomach cries out for food. The physical body cries out to reproduce. The body demands to breathe, to work, to move and to function. When there are gateway challenges that are persistent, such as the denial of a perceived sexual need, the energy system is set up to become blocked along certain lines that create the perception, in the soul that is experiencing this, that there is a red-ray energy blockage, and on the level of the observation, this is correct. On the level of the solution of this observation, if there can be said to be a solution, this is not correct.



For, as we said, there is much more connection between the chakras and the effect of one chakra upon another than this instrument, and many perhaps, give the energy body credit for possessing. So in truth, a blockage in red ray, in the most linear sense, does block energy so that it cannot rise up into the heart chakra and, therefore, be available for work in consciousness. But more than that, it is a non-physical energy that is not a sexual energy, nor is it a survival energy, but it is, rather, energy. In truth, you see, the energy body does not respond to physical stimuli. In an energetic sense the body is completely a creature of the mind and the spirit and the emotions. So those feelings that are within, those desires and thirsts, as complex and interrelated as they usually are, are actually, at the heart, a blockage within the energy body. And because the needs of an incarnational being are complex, the blockages, over-activations and other distortions within the energy body, are significantly more complex than can be determined by analysis using the intellectual mind.



We would suggest that one way to work on blockages within the energetic body is to give to the self the resources of the energy body clearing or balancing, which we have talked about through this instrument before. Since we have talked about this before, we will recapitulate rather succinctly by saying that the point of energy balancing is simply to go through the day’s experiences as one remembers them, sitting quietly at the end of the day, in a reflective mode and simply being with each distortion that can be remembered from the harvest of the day’s emotions, whether that distortion was towards a positive emotion or towards a negative emotion, as perceived by the seeker. For all distortions from balance are equally useful for looking at and for allowing into the arena of the meditational mind in order that, in silence and in the release of control, there may be allowed to enter into the energy system that help which is available from those unseen beings which surround and guard and guide each seeker.



This instrument works with her own energy balancing in this way very seldom because the technique involves looking at each emotion, allowing it to intensify to the point of really heavy intensity, and then allowing that emotion’s exact opposite to enter into the equation until both sides of, say, impatience and patience can be seen in a balanced fashion. However, this instrument does use a visualization technique in order to balance its energies. This is helpful for those whose visualization abilities are dull enough that there is not the danger of over-intensification or over-dramatization of emotion which would sweep away the possibility of balancing. In this visualization technique there is simply the request for help from guidance, and when that guidance has been secured, there is the request that this guidance help in seeing in an inner or intuitive sense the actual colors of the chakra centers to see if they are at the same color tone, the same color intensity, and the same degree of lightness of tone within each color. This way, it can be seen intuitively if an energy center seems muddy or dark or weak or attenuated.



It is possible to work with balancing techniques using the balancing meditation or using the visualization technique. Either one of these signals to the energy body that care is being given to the body, that concern from the heart is being offered to the body, and this is greatly reassuring to the body and helps, whether or not the balancing meditation or visualization seems to be successful from the conscious standpoint.



Another aspect which may well help with unclogging blockages is simply to act on the emotion which has been engendered. By this we mean that the basic emotion engendered is located, to the best degree of accuracy possible by the seeker, and then expressed. In the instance that the one known as R spoke of and related the one known as P’s speaking of, the experience was that of waking up [from a night’s sleep] and immediately feeling such a degree of frustration that the desire is to scream. We would encourage moving to a place of safety and screaming, when this feeling occurs. It is not wise to upset others, nor is it wise to upset the environment. However, it is very wise to acknowledge and express emotion when it can be done without infringing upon the free will of others or destroying something within the self. There is a real spiritual value in acknowledging primal distress and in expressing it, even in the most primitive emotional release such as the scream, for it is a scream from the heart that wants to survive, not simply the body that wishes to reproduce or to express its sexual nature. This is the surface of the energy distortion but not its essence. And the seeming catalyst for energy distortion is almost never a linear match with the catalyst that produced it. For within the energy body the system of unconscious memory connection and memory within other lifetimes which includes relationships with this issue or with the entity which is giving catalyst on this issue are numerous. And, consequently, the rational mind, in waking consciousness, shall not be able significantly to penetrate the nature of the actual energy distortion.



Perhaps we may say that beyond a certain point, it is well to rely on faith. We always come back to the simplicity of the situation and the unity of the situation, for all energy is one. There is not sexual energy, personal energy, family and group energy, heart energy and so forth. There are aspects to the energy, colors, shall we say, to the energy as it moves through those centers of energy and connection within the energy bodies. But the energy itself is limitless white light and although it may be distorted in its shadows within the energetic physical body connection, within the energetic body itself and at the source of the problem, it is all the same energy. And this is a key concept, we feel. For this lifts the seeker beyond the limitation of a concept of her problem and places the waiting heart and the energy body which is listening to that heart in a situation of being aware of the larger picture. And what one accepts into the waking mind becomes the door that opens the potential of the solution to be approached and released from its stricture.



First, there is the faith that all is well. This is a significant step for one who is suffering, for the physical body wants to react in a fear-based manner. The instincts of the physical body are to protect and control for the safety of the physical body. And so there is the feeling, when one is in discomfort, that one needs to control that situation. One needs to achieve a comfort zone. However, often within your density you have made choices as a seeker before incarnation that place you in a situation where you will continue to suffer, and that is what was intended. It was not seen before incarnation that this would be precisely suffering. It was seen that this would be learning. It was seen that this would be a great opportunity to make the breakthrough, the step forward as a spiritual being in evolution. Evolution is change. Change is difficult. Change is painful. Change engenders suffering. Consequently, some blockages that are looked at and are experienced are placed there by the self before incarnation, not in order to break through quickly, but in order to initiate a process of self-acceptance, self-understanding and self-forgiveness that is far deeper than the issue that begins this process of understanding, acceptance, healing and forgiveness.



Secondly, there is the faith that there is help available beyond what is available to the rational mind, and that this help is benign, kindly and intelligent. Once one has the basic attitude of faith, that regardless of appearances all is well, there is a door within the heart that opens, that has been closed by fear. It will continue to wish to close, again and again and again. And this is why daily meditation and the entering of the silence is so central, even if it is but for a few moments. That connection with the silence empowers the resources of the connections between physical and energetic bodies and between the connections in the energetic body to those bodies which are involved in the guidance of the higher self that is moving to help the self within third density. The faith that all is well, and that help is there, together, have a tremendously comforting and strengthening effect. However, as we said, in the face of apparent physical imbalance that continues over a period of time, this sense of well-being will again and again be compromised by the instinctive fear-based reactions of the physical vehicle which feels that it is being threatened in its ability to survive.



There is, as this instrument has said, no issue tougher than the red-ray issue because that natural function is so strong in the physical body, and the emotional need for connection and companionship, which sexuality is the door to within your peoples, is so very strong. There is, certainly, no way that any can control and, by doing or not doing some physical thing, solve the discomfort of the physical body when its natural sexual functions are denied. When this occurs, according to the nature of the individual and its energy system, there will be some degree of suffering. For some entities it is negligible, unnoticeable, or minor. For others it is an enormous and very substantial problem and certainly one that cannot be ignored. This instrument is aware that the one known as P has said that the mechanical satisfaction, on a solitary basis, of the physical desire for sexual completion had not been satisfactory, no matter how many times repeated, and we are not surprised at this because of the fact that the sexual energy blockage is actually not what it seems, but rather, a much deeper and more profound suffering that extends throughout the body system of the energetic body, if not the physical body.



In one very basic sense we must say that as far as we know there are times of suffering for all people. There are always needs that will not be met that seem important, and this is part of the way that the school of love that planet Earth is works. For again and again, it allows the senses of the physical body to inform the intellect that there is not enough, that there is no safety and that there is no healing. It is the challenge of the spiritually oriented entity to gaze at the limited and crying needs of the body, not with eyes to solve, but with eyes to love and understand, to enter into the experience, to enter into the suffering, to enter into all of the emotions that this brings up and to see the self in its needs, in its wants, in its character as defined by those cries of hunger. What one desires is extremely interesting to the developing soul, and it is very well to look at what one desires, not with the eye to judge, but with the hope of fully embracing the self, of being in love with that suffering self, of rocking that self within the heart and saying, “Yes, these needs are beautiful; these needs are worthy; these needs are fully acceptable and simply are not being met by the circumstances of my life.”



This is, again and again, in one way and then another, the situation of the seeker within the physical plane. There is not enough. There is no healing. There is only suffering. This is a dark picture, and we would say to you that it is dark as the earth itself. The soil beneath the feet is dark. It is dark, mysterious and fertile. It is the seed of something that will grow through the soil, through the suffering, through the point of pain, to blooming at last in ways that cannot be comprehended at the moment that the suffering is being experienced. Perhaps you could look at the picture as a puzzle that one is so close to that one can only see thirty-five pieces out of the two thousand, and it looks, therefore, like the problem is about a dog and a man. But if one pulls back to gaze at the entire picture, the dog and the man are at the edge of a much larger conflict that involves many more characters and many more issues. When a cycle of suffering has been completed, it is far more easy in hindsight to look into the pattern and say, “Yes, I see the sense of this suffering. I see the point of this catalyst being offered to me. I see where it took me and what I learned, and I am grateful.” We are suggesting that that attitude of gratefulness and thankfulness for the suffering be adopted by faith beforetimes, so that in the midst of suffering, control is released; needs are expressed to the self by the self and then let go. And it is acknowledged that beyond all need, beyond all distortions of energy, beyond all suffering, beyond all limitation, the essence of self is perfect and resting in the most divine love and in the most strong and healing light.



We would at this time transfer this contact to the one known as Jim. We thank this instrument for offering itself as channel and we thank the group for its very interesting question. We leave this instrument in love and in light and transfer at this time. We are those of Q'uo.



*(Jim channeling)*



I am Q'uo, and greet each again in love and in light through this instrument. We are privileged at this time to offer ourselves in the attempt to speak to any further queries which this group may have for us. Is there another query at this time?



**S**: I’ll start. The thing I am curious about is when we gather each week we talk about what we have been doing during the previous week, and I thought I should give you the opportunity to tell us how your week was.



I am Q'uo, and am aware of your query, my brother. The experience which we have had since last joining with this group is one of the exploration of the interior of the self, shall we say. This is our means of becoming the one Creator. We continue to move along our evolutionary path in what might be seen to be small steps, investigating those portions of the self that is the Creator which have been, shall we say, less well appreciated in our previous experience. And, of course, we move in service to others where possible. In most instances this is accomplished by making an appearance, as you would say, within the dream state of those whom we seek to serve. Thus, we are modest in our work and in our service.



Is there another query at this time?



**S**: Are there any messages from any of our other unseen friends at this time?



I am Q'uo, and am aware of your query, my brother. Those of the host of heaven, as we have heard it called, merely send their love and light to all who are available to receive it.



Is there another query, my brother?



**S**: Not at this time. Thanks.



I am Q'uo, and we thank you, my brother. Is there another query at this time?



**R**: I don’t ever remember being aware of Q'uo in my dream state. Do you do it more on an energetic level rather than as an identity?



I am Q'uo, and am aware of your query, my brother. When we are able to make such a visitation, it is most often in a situation in which the entity which we seek to serve has found itself in what you would call dire straits and is calling for aid by the amount of suffering and pain that the entity experiences in its life. In such a situation of extreme need, we are sometimes able to make our presence felt in an inspirational manner to such an entity. This is somewhat rare, as you would term it, but is a means of service which we have pursued from the days of old, in this planetary sphere’s history.



Is there another query, my brother?



**R**: No. Not a question. But thank you for that answer. I derive some comfort from knowing that we all do have unseen help.



I am Q'uo, and we thank you, my brother. Is there another query at this time?



**S**: Recently a woman we work with had her mother pass away. Today my sister-in-law’s father came very close to dying, and I was wondering if there were any words or thoughts or ideas that I could share with them to help them with the struggle that they are going through now?



I am Q'uo, and am aware of your query, my brother. When one wishes to serve in a situation in which there has been the loss of a loved one and there is much suffering and grief on the part of those who remain, it is often the best service simply to be available for whatever needs are felt by those who grieve. Thus the offering of one’s efforts in providing the foodstuffs, as we are aware you have prepared to do, is one such means of service that is much appreciated by those who are at such a time thinking about little else than the loved one who has departed. It is also possible that if one feels there is an opening in the grieving entity, that they be approached by suggesting that there is the completion of a grand design or plan that has been accomplished by the one who has left, and that this plane continues beyond this earthly experience, where an ending is a beginning upon another level. Then there may be some comfort that can be given to the heart, to the mind and to the soul. For as those who grieve are reminded of that which they know—that all life continues, that all springs from one Creator, that we do that which is ours to do, and that there is truly no loss at any time—this reminding of the basic elements of the spiritual journey is often helpful and appreciated.



Is there a further query, my brother?



**S**: My wife still has much swelling and pain from her broken ankle and she requested to know if there was any other lesson, meaning or whatever that she should further examine at this time?



I am Q'uo, and am aware of your query, my brother. As we consider the situation of the one known as C, we would recommend that she has processed well that catalyst which has come before her. The healing that remains may be bothersome and lengthy, yet it is that which is necessary in order that the catalyst be utilized to its fullest. We see no further mental examination necessary for this entity. We add our blessing and healing vibrations to those many wishes of renewed health which have been offered to the one known as C.



Is there another query at this time?



**S**: No. Thank you.



I am Q'uo. Again, we thank you, my brother. Is there another query at this time?



**Carla**: I’d like to follow up on S’s query. It seems like if you need to do one thing to solve catalyst that has come up for you, it doesn’t necessarily solve the problem. Is there ever a situation in which the problem is what you think it is, and something that you do in the physical will take care of it nicely, or is it always, metaphysically speaking, that the roots of the situation are hidden?



I am Q'uo, and am aware of your query, my sister. Though we do not wish to discourage any from examining carefully each portion of catalyst that comes before the notice, when the conscious mind has finally noticed the catalyst that has come before it much has already been lost to the determination of the proper path to travel. This is merely the nature of the heavy, chemical illusion in which you find yourselves in third density. It is very difficult to perceive clearly those messages which are sent from the subconscious mind and the metaphysical realms, for it is as though a different language were being spoken and the ears that hear this language perceive only dimly that which is intended. Thus it is well to use not only the conscious analytical mind but also wise to employ the intuition, the hunches, those feelings that come through the veil of forgetting and leave the trace of meaning, the—we give this instrument the phrase—the niggle of direction that one may follow as one would follow the trail of bread crumbs in the deep forest, looking again for the path that one took into such an imposing and isolated area.



When one examines carefully the subconscious mind, as carefully as one can, shall we say, one will discover that there are trees of immense size, ferns of indescribable beauty, mosses unknown before, creatures strange and exotic, air barely able to be breathed and yet exhilarating in its intake. Thus when one examines catalyst for its origin and direction to utilize, one may rest assured that this is a process which itself can become a journey into exotic realms. The fruit that is found in such a place is well worth the effort, whether one is able to feast at the entire meal or only the hors d’ouvres.



Is there another query, my sister?



**Carla**: I had more questions but I feel the energy is getting low. If you wish to comment, you said that there was a language of the energy body, and I was thinking: was that the language of emotions? When I work with music or words, as in poetry, or with colors, all of those things seem to me to work well with the energy body and to clarify my own emotions and bring them out. I was thinking emotions would be the better language for the energetic body than would be intellectual analysis.



I am Q'uo, and am aware of your query, my sister. We also are aware that the energy of the circle is low. We shall comment briefly.



The emotions are an avenue of exploration that also deserve a great deal of effort. The attempt to interpret catalyst and its application to future action—this is the direction that we were intending when we suggested that intuitions be examined, for intuitions are a more purified kind of emotion from another source, these intuitions being that property of the subconscious mind, the first translation, shall we say, of the language that the conscious mind attempts to understand. Thus we suggest that the intuition and, as you have suggested, the emotions, be employed more as a fundamental means of examining catalyst, rather than allowing the intellectual mind the sole effort in this endeavor.



Is there a further query, my sister?



**Carla**: No. And I really thank you for that answer, Q'uo.



I am Q'uo, and we thank you, my sister. Is there a final query at this time?



*(No further queries.)*



I am Q'uo. We would take this opportunity to thank each once again for inviting us to join this circle of working. We are aware that the effort that each has made to become a member in this circle this day has been great, for there have been obstacles that made it difficult for each to partake. And we thank each for being a part of this circle, for inviting our presence, for seeking with a true and sincere heart that which is our opinion, and that which we joyfully give, though we recommend that each observe those words which ring of truth for each. Take those and leave all others behind. We are known to you as those of Q'uo, and we would take our leave of this instrument and this group at this time, leaving each, as always, in the love and in the light of the one infinite Creator. Adonai, my friends. Adonai.
